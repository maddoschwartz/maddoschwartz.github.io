                            Hi! My name is Madeleine. I'm a software engineer, gardener, and
                            sourdough enthusiast! I love to ride my bike on trails or
                            busy urban streets, and I can knit a stitch or two.<br><br>
                
                            Right now I'm working at a satellite internet company called Viasat
                            and training for a marathon! Wish me luck getting to 26.2 miles!

                            I had originally enrolled in the introductory computer science 
                            class on a whim simply to fulfill a math requiredment!
                            While I would have never imaged that two years later
                            I would now have several more math credits and a major
                            in computer science, I did see myself tackling
                            problems and creating real solutions. And I've done this
                            by not only designing and implementing programs, but by 
                            also asking ethical questions and discussing policies. <br><br>
                
                            This semester I am excited to be taking courses on programming
                            langugage design, internet-scale distributed systems, linear
                            algebra, political revolutions, and Soviet politics. <br><br>

                            in which food and cooking shapes our lives. As we interview
                            friends and members from the Tufts Community, we learn about
                            the ways cooking is an expression of love, a memory of
                            family and culture, and fun and creative outlet that
                            nourishes us.
