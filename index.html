			<div id="about">
			Hi! My name is Madeleine. I'm a student, journalist, and
			Catan enthusiast! I love to ride my bike on trails or
			busy urban streets, and I can knit a stitch or two.

			Medford, MA <br><br>
			B.S. in Computer Science and Political Science <br><br>

			Favorite Courses: Data Structures, Machine Structure and 
			Assembly Language, Discrete Math, Gender Work and 
			Politics in East Asia, Latin American Politics, Intro
			to Ethics <br><br>

			Tufts has given me a unique experience where I have
			been able to explore different fields, discover new 
			interests, and challenge my world perspective. I had 
			originally enrolled in the introductory computer science 
			class on a whim simply to fulfill a math requiredment.
			While I would have never imaged that two years later,
			I would now have several more math credits and a major
			in computer science, I did see myself tackling
			problems and creating real solutions. And I've done this
			by not only designing and implementing programs, but by 
			also asking ethical questions, and discussing national policies. <br><br>

			This semester I am excited to be taking classes on 
			computer security, algorithms, ceramics, epistemology,
			and middle eastern politics. <br><br>
